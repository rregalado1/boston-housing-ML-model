# 🏠 Boston Housing Price Prediction

This project implements a simple **Linear Regression model** using **Scikit-Learn** to predict housing prices based on the classic Boston Housing dataset.

## 📊 Project Overview
The dataset contains information about houses in Boston, including features like:
- Average number of rooms per dwelling
- Crime rate
- Distance to employment centers
- Property tax rate
- Pupil-teacher ratio, and more.

The model predicts the **median value of owner-occupied homes** (`MEDV`).

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python 3
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib (optional for visualization)

## 🚀 Steps
1. Load and explore the dataset  
2. Split data into training and testing sets  
3. Train a **Linear Regression** model  
4. Evaluate performance using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
